MATHS QOL

rangeInt: calculates range and returns an integer value. Doesnt matter which way around the numbers are entered. Entering a float into here will only result in a rounded calculation. 
rangeFloat: calculates the range and returns a float value. if an integter is entered it will return with the same answer but as a float and not integer. doesnt matter which way around the numbers go in
Mean: calcultes the mean of an array inputed. the data type must either be a float/double or an integer. always returns as a float so cast if you need as an integer and be weary that it may cause an error if the calculated result is not an integer value.
Median. takes an array as an input. always returns a float. calculates the median.
Mode. takes an array. calcules the modal value. if there is no singular modal value then there an array with all of the values of the same maximum frequency appear

Other QOL

triangleFractle: this isnt really quality of life but if you want to show off or just see something call, call this function
BinarySearch: this takes an array and then a search value. returns "Not Found" if it isnt found and "Found At Index (the index it found it at)"
ValueExists: this is not a main function this is one for the other functions however if you feel like using it this is how. it takes a string input. if return a true or false with an index if it is true. it is checking whether or not the name that you placed in exists as a saved value in the "Save.txt" text document. the index is the line that it is saved to. 
WriteToSaveFile: this is another non-main function but if you feel liek using it you can. it takes a string value for a name, a value of choice for the value and finally the data type that you chose for the value. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE DATA TYPE IN THE END IS EITHER: #INT#, #BOOL#, #FLOAT#, #STRING#. an example is here. "other.WriteToSaveFile("TestVar", 107, #INT#)"
SaveInt, SaveFloat, SaveString, SaveBool. each of these functions takes a name and a value of their respective data type.
ReadInt, ReadFloat, ReadString, ReadBool. each of these functions takes a name of a saved value you are looking for. they all return a value if found and the correct data type is found.
